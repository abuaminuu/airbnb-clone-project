3. Review System: allows users to leave reviews and ratings for properties
5. Data Optimization: ensure efficient data retrievaland storage through database optimizations

Tech Stack
1. Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API and web applications.
2. Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
3. PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
4. GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data in the database.
5. Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
6. Redis: Used for caching and session management.
7. Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
8. CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.


ðŸ‘¥ Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.


Database Design

key entities required for the project:
entity: fields ---> relations
Users: id, username, password, email --> user can have multiple property, book multiple properties, can review/rate a property, pay for property, recieve payment.
Properties: id, name, --> property is own by only one user
Bookings: id, booking details --> user who owns the booked a property 
Reviews: id, property_reviewed 
Payments: id amount sender, reciever

Feature Details

Here are the features with 2-3 sentence descriptions:
1. User Management
The User Management feature allows hosts and guests to create profiles, manage their accounts, and track their activities on the platform. This feature contributes to the project by enabling users to maintain their personal information and history, building trust within the community. It also allows for personalized experiences and targeted recommendations.
2. Property Management
The Property Management feature enables hosts to create and manage listings for their properties, including descriptions, photos, and availability. This feature contributes to the project by allowing hosts to showcase their properties and manage bookings efficiently. It also ensures that guests have access to accurate and detailed information about properties.
3. Booking System
The Booking System feature allows guests to search for and book properties based on their preferences and dates. This feature contributes to the project by streamlining the booking process and reducing friction between hosts and guests. It also enables hosts to manage their bookings and availability more efficiently.
4. Payment Processing
The Payment Processing feature enables secure transactions between guests and hosts, handling payments and payouts seamlessly. This feature contributes to the project by providing a convenient and secure way for guests to pay for bookings, and for hosts to receive payments. It also reduces the risk of payment disputes and ensures timely payments.
5. Review System
The Review System feature allows guests and hosts to rate and review each other after a booking, promoting accountability and trust within the community. This feature contributes to the project by helping to build trust and credibility among users, and ensuring that high-quality hosts and properties are recognized. It also provides valuable feedback for hosts to improve their services.
6. Data Optimization
The Data Optimization feature uses data analytics and machine learning to improve the user experience, personalize recommendations, and optimize platform performance. This feature contributes to the project by providing users with relevant and accurate results, and enabling the platform to adapt to changing user behavior and preferences. It also helps to identify trends and opportunities for growth.

API Security
##
Airbnb's API security is designed to protect hosts and guests and ensure a secure payment process. Here are some key aspects Â¹:
API-connected hosts: Hosts using property management software (PMS) connected to Airbnb's API can collect security deposits outside of Airbnb's system, but must disclose this in their listings.
Security deposit management: API-connected hosts can manage security deposits through their PMS, including setting deposit amounts, charging deposits, and refunding deposits.
AirCover protection: Airbnb's AirCover provides up to $3 million in damage protection for hosts, but API-connected hosts may choose to collect security deposits separately to cover specific incidents or damages not covered by AirCover.
To ensure API security, Airbnb likely implements measures such as:
Authentication and authorization: Verifying the identity of API users and controlling access to sensitive data.
Data encryption: Protecting data transmitted between systems using encryption.
Secure payment processing: Handling payments securely through approved payment processors.
Hosts can also take steps to secure their API connections, such as:
Using approved property management software: Ensuring that their PMS is connected to Airbnb's API and compliant with security requirements.
Clearly disclosing security deposit policies: Including information about security deposits in their listings to avoid confusion.
Following Airbnb's guidelines: Adhering to Airbnb's policies and procedures for handling security deposits and disputes.
By implementing these measures, Airbnb aims to provide a secure environment for hosts and guests to conduct transactions.
##
Key Security Measures:
Authentication: Verifying the identity of users through secure login mechanisms, such as OAuth or JWT (JSON Web Tokens), to ensure only authorized access to the system.
Authorization: Controlling access to sensitive data and features based on user roles and permissions, ensuring users can only perform actions they are allowed to.
Rate Limiting: Limiting the number of API requests from a single user or IP address within a certain time frame to prevent abuse, brute-force attacks, or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
Data Encryption: Encrypting data both in transit (using HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (using encryption algorithms like AES) to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
Input Validation and Sanitization: Validating and sanitizing user input to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks.
Secure Payment Processing: Implementing secure payment gateways, such as Stripe or PayPal, to handle transactions securely and comply with industry standards like PCI-DSS.
Why Security is Crucial:
Protecting User Data: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data, such as personal information, booking history, and payment details.
Securing Payments: Protecting financial transactions and sensitive payment information from unauthorized access or theft, maintaining trust and preventing financial losses.
Preventing Unauthorized Access: Restricting access to sensitive areas of the system, preventing malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities or stealing sensitive data.
Maintaining Trust and Reputation: Demonstrating a commitment to security and protecting user data helps build trust with customers, partners, and stakeholders, ultimately preserving the project's reputation.
By implementing these key security measures, the project can effectively mitigate potential risks, protect user data, and ensure a secure experience for all stakeholders.
